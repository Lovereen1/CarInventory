In this worksheet, I have used LEFT, MID, right and vlookup formulas. I have created visual representation of the data in the form of pivot table. Pivot table will show 
the miles covered by each drives and the same data is representated in the form of line chart. I have made use of scattered to represent the car driven per year and used 
conditional formatting and sorted the cars by largest distance covered to smallest.
